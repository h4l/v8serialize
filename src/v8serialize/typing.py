# We need to define our own specialised extension protocols of Sequence and
# MutableSequence, and we want other classes to be able to extend our protocols
# without also inheriting the ABC implementations of Sequence. e.g. so that you
# can extend the list class plus our protocol and manually add our methods,
# while using list's Sequence implementation.

# The general rule here is that the TYPE_CHECKING version should inherit the
# actual typing.XXX type we want, e.g. Mapping. The runtime version should only
# inherit Protocol, plus perhaps any of our similarly-defined protocols it
# needs.
#
# The runtime version needs to use @runtime_checkable plus stub method
# definitions, so that isinstance checks know which callable properties to look
# for. Also use typing.XXX.register() on the runtime version so that it becomes
# a virtual subclass of the intended type, so that
# isinstance(typing.XXX, runtime_instance) works at runtime.
