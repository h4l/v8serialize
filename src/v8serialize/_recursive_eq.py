    """Allow `==` of classes with self-referencing fields.

    This class decorator wraps `__eq__` to detect and short-circuit `__eq__`
    being called on an object as a result of itself checking its own equality.
    This allows objects that contain direct or indirect references to themself
    to compare with `==`, without infinite recursive calls until stack overflow.

    Self-referential objects are equal to others if both sides use the same
    object-identity structure (according to `is` / `id()`) and their own
    `__eq__` is `True`.

    For example `a -> b -> a` can be equal to `a' -> b' -> a'`, but will not be
    equal to `a' -> b' -> A' -> B' -> a'` (assuming `a` would be equal to `A` in
    isolation). In the first case, the identity structure has two nodes
    repeating, in the second there are four nodes, so the object-identity
    structure is different.
